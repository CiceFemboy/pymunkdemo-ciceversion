this commandis important as it it enables you to read scripts in the working directory instead of inside the embeded python directory.
4. install pip
run on python >> exec(open("get-pip.py").read()) <<
there should be logs of the installation and new files inside the python folder. Pip is now installed
the command window should close, if not close it
